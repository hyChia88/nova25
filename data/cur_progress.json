        "[Concept] Initially conflated concurrency with parallelism; after timeline + interleaving demo, can now define both distinctly but still occasionally says “simultaneous” for concurrency.",

        "[Examples] Can explain UI responsiveness (concurrency) vs matrix multiply on multiple cores (parallelism).",
